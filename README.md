##Motivation

This project was built to experiment with the handlebars tool. 

##Tech used

built with Javascript, basic css, bootstrap, mysql, handlebars, and express, and of course sequalize

##Features

This application allows a user to input a style of burger that they like. When the submit button is clicked that burger is then added to the mysql database, and from there shows up in the uneaten burger list. Upon clicking the "eat it" button, the associated burger's devoured status is set to true and moved over to the burgers eaten column. From this column the user can click the "regurg the burg" button to set the devoured status to false and allows the burger to be consumed again and again for endless enjoyment and universal horror. All accomplished now with the use of sequelize.
